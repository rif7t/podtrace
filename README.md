A simple but powerful eBPF-based diagnostic tool for Kubernetes applications.

## Overview

`podtrace` attaches eBPF programs to a single Kubernetes pod's container and prints high-level, human-readable events that help diagnose application issues.

## Features

- **Network Connection Monitoring**: Tracks TCP IPv4/IPv6 connection latency and errors
- **TCP RTT Analysis**: Detects RTT spikes and retry patterns
- **File System Monitoring**: Tracks read, write, and fsync operations with latency analysis
- **CPU/Scheduling Tracking**: Monitors thread blocking and CPU scheduling events
- **DNS Tracking**: Monitors DNS lookups
- **CPU Usage per Process**: Shows CPU consumption by process
- **Process Activity Analysis**: Shows which processes are generating events
- **Diagnose Mode**: Collects events for a specified duration and generates a comprehensive summary report

## Prerequisites

- Linux kernel 5.8+ with BTF support
- Go 1.24+
- Kubernetes cluster access

## Building

```bash
# Install dependencies
make deps

# Build eBPF program and Go binary
make build

# Build and set capabilities
make build-setup
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Trace a pod in real-time
./bin/podtrace -n production my-pod

# Run in diagnostic mode
./bin/podtrace -n production my-pod --diagnose 20s
```

### Diagnose Report

The diagnose mode generates a comprehensive report including:

- **Summary Statistics**: Total events, events per second, collection period
- **DNS Statistics**: DNS lookup latency, errors, top targets
- **TCP Statistics**: RTT analysis, spikes detection, send/receive operations
- **Connection Statistics**: IPv4/IPv6 connection latency, failures, error breakdown, top targets
- **File System Statistics**: Read, write, and fsync operation latency, slow operations
- **CPU Statistics**: Thread blocking times and scheduling events
- **CPU Usage by Process**: CPU percentage per process
- **Process Activity**: Top active processes by event count
- **Activity Timeline**: Event distribution over time
- **Activity Bursts**: Detection of burst periods
- **Connection Patterns**: Analysis of connection behavior
- **Network I/O Patterns**: Send/receive ratios and throughput analysis
- **Potential Issues**: Automatic detection of high error rates and performance problems

## Running without sudo

After building, set capabilities to run without sudo:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/setup-capabilities.sh
```




## Podtrace Prometheus & Grafana Integration

`podtrace` exposes runtime metrics for Kubernetes pods using a built-in Prometheus endpoint. These metrics cover networking, DNS, CPU scheduling, and file system operations, all labeled per process and event type.

---

Running:

```bash
./bin/podtrace -n production my-pod --metrics
```

launches an HTTP server accessible at:

```bash
http://localhost:3000/metrics
```

## Prometheus Scrape Configuration

set <PODTRACE_HOST> to the address of the pod or host running podtrace.
```bash
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'podtrace'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['<PODTRACE_HOST>:3000']
```
## Available Metrics
All metrics are exported per process and per event type:
| Metric                                   | Description                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `podtrace_rtt_seconds`                   | Histogram of TCP RTTs                           |
| `podtrace_rtt_latest_seconds`            | Most recent TCP RTT                             |
| `podtrace_latency_seconds`               | Histogram of TCP send/receive latency           |
| `podtrace_latency_latest_seconds`        | Most recent TCP latency                         |
| `podtrace_dns_latency_seconds_gauge`     | Latest DNS query latency                        |
| `podtrace_dns_latency_seconds_histogram` | Distribution of DNS query latencies             |
| `podtrace_fs_latency_seconds_gauge`      | Latest file system operation latency            |
| `podtrace_fs_latency_seconds_histogram`  | Distribution of file system operation latencies |
| `podtrace_cpu_block_seconds_gauge`       | Latest CPU block time                           |
| `podtrace_cpu_block_seconds_histogram`   | Distribution of CPU block times                 |

## Grafana Dashboard

A ready-to-use Grafana dashboard JSON is included in the repository at `podtrace/internal/metricsexporter/dashboard/Podtrace-Dashboard.json`


## Steps to use:

- Open Grafana and go to Dashboards → New → Import.

- Paste the JSON or upload the .json file.

Select or your Prometheus datasource as the datasource.

Import. The dashboard will display per-process and per-event-type metrics for RTT, latency, DNS, FS, and CPU block time.
